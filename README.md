# Stems
## Bespoke procgen text expansion in Typescript/ES6. Heavily inspired by Tracery.

Stems is a tool for generating text from a grammar.
It's super lightweight and I made it specifically for some procgen I was doing.

[Tracery](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery) is more featureful, 
more battle tested, has real tooling, has an actual community, 
and you should probably use that.
